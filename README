Video-FFmpeg-Streamer
======================================

Module to make transcoding, saving and broadcasting AV streams simple.

This module requires FFmpeg development libraries, preferably >= 0.6


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DESCRIPTION

This module is an attempt to encapsulate high-level media streaming
operations in a perl module. It does this by wrapping libav* in an XS
interface which is utilized by various modules.

To understand how this module is put together, you must be familiar
with how media files are structured and how libav* reflects this.

A media file or media stream is generally encapsulated in a
"container" format which can contain any number of video, audio or
subtitle streams. For a concrete example think of a DVD, which lets
you select different audio or subtitles for the same video
stream. Common container formats are MOV, AVI, WebM/Matroska, FLV,
MPEG TS (transport stream), OGG. 
These containers are handled by libavformat which understands how to
mux and demux streams inside a given container. A container open for
reading or writing with associated parameters is represented by an
AVFormatContext.

Each stream inside a container contains video or audio data which is
encoded and decoded by a codec. Common codecs are MPEG1 video, MPEG2
(DVD video), MPEG3 audio (aka MP3), MPEG4 and h264, WMV, AAC, FLV,
Vorbis, Theora. libavcodec contains a vast and impressive number of
codecs, and a coder or decoder instance is represented by an
AVCodecContext which is an AVCodec reference plus encoding/decoding
parameters.

Example media format (DVD):
|-------------------------------------|
| Container (DVD)                     |
|                                     |
|    |------------------|             |
|    | stream 1 (video) |             |
|    |------------------|             |
|                                     |
|    |--------------------------|     |
|    | stream 2 (english audio) |     |
|    |--------------------------|     |
|                                     |
|    |--------------------------|     |
|    | stream 2 (german audio)  |     |
|    |--------------------------|     |
|                                     |
|    |------------------------------| |
|    | stream 3 (english subtitles) | |
|    |------------------------------| |
|                                     |
|    |------------------------------| |
|    | stream 4 (german subtitles)  | |
|    |------------------------------| |
|                                     |
|-------------------------------------|

If you were to read in an AVI file and decode it for playback with
libavformat and libavcodec, you would first create an AVFormatContext
for reading AVI files. Once the file is opened and loaded, you would
be able to access the audio and video streams contained therein. You
would locate the appropriate AVCodecs for decoding the stream data and
get AVCodecContexts for each stream.

This module attempts to simplify this process. See
Video::FFmpeg::Streamer docs for details on usage.
